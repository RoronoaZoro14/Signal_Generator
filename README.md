# Signal_Generator
Signal generators are one of the most useful devices in embedded systems as they help in 
generating different kinds of signal with variable frequency and variable duty cycle. These 
signals can be used for prototyping, powering and even interfacing different kinds of sensors. In 
this project a signal generator with selectable signal type (Sine & Square) is created. The signals 
produced by the signal generator will range from selectable frequency of (10Hz to 2kHz) and 
adjustable duty cycle from (10% to 100%).

The signal generator will have a user-friendly GUI (Graphical User Interface). Which will be 
implemented using a touchscreen that will be used to set the type of signal to be generated along 
with its parameters like the frequency and duty cycle that can be changes using the up and down 
arrows designed in the touch screen. The absolute specifications of signal generator are listed as 
follows: 
1. Output signals: Sine and Square 
2. Frequency range: (10Hz to 2kHz) 
3. Duty cycle adjustability: (10% to 100%) with 5% increments 
4. User Interface: TFT-LCD with touch panel.
